# Seismic-Hazard-due-to-Fluid-Injections
 Code used to simulate fluid-induced microseismicity in Lord-May et al. 2020, Seismic Hazard due to Fluid Injections

The model should be fairly well commented. Simulates fluid-induced microseismicity while allowing fractures to extend beyond the fluid front.
None of the analysis code is included here.
